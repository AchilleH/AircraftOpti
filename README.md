# AircraftOpti
Preliminary Aircraft Design Optimizer

## Optimization
goal is to incorporate stability funcitons into main script as well as have the script store all trials and their successes for future viewing 

TODO:
- Incorporate stability into main
- Change from iterative to rand inputs
- Create array of Aircraft structs to store trial data
- Plot histograms of trial data, success rate hist and fail hist
